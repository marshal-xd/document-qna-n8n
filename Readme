# 📄 Document Q&A Chatbot

A document-based question-answering system built using **n8n**, **Pinecone**, **Hugging Face**, and **OpenAI**.  
This project allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions directly about their content through a conversational interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically loads and processes PDF documents from Google Drive  
- Splits text into smaller, manageable chunks for embedding  
- Generates embeddings using **Hugging Face** models  
- Stores vector embeddings efficiently in **Pinecone**  
- Retrieves the most relevant text segments for each query  
- Uses **OpenAI Chat** models to generate accurate and context-aware answers  
- Provides an interactive document-based Q&A workflow built entirely in **n8n**

## 🧠 Workflow Explanation

1. **Document Ingestion:**  
   PDFs are automatically fetched from a connected Google Drive folder.  
   Each file is converted to text for further processing.

2. **Text Chunking:**  
   The text is split into smaller sections to improve embedding and retrieval accuracy.

3. **Embedding Generation:**  
   The **Hugging Face Embedding Node** generates numerical vector representations (embeddings) of each chunk.

4. **Vector Storage:**  
   Embeddings are stored in a **Pinecone** index for fast and scalable similarity searches.

5. **Query Workflow:**  
   When a user asks a question, the query is embedded and matched against the most relevant chunks from Pinecone.

6. **Response Generation:**  
   The **OpenAI Chat Node** uses the retrieved context to generate natural and precise answers.

7. **Chat Interface:**  
   The system allows users to interact with their documents as if they were chatting with them.
